#####  Hello! My name is Lean Alvarez, and I am currently a student at UC Davis majoring in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. After taking Dr. Joel Ledford's BIS15L (Data Science for Biology) course, I have discovered a passion for R. This repository is about me practicing R using the book *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickman and Garrett Grolemund in hopes of improving in and eventually mastering R.
